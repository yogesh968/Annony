## 🤝 Contributing Guide

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! We welcome your ideas, suggestions, and improvements. Before you begin, please read the guidelines below to keep everything organized and consistent.

---

### 📁 Project Setup Guidelines

* **Do NOT include `node_modules/`** in your pull requests.
  Add `node_modules/` to `.gitignore` if not already present.

* **Always create a new branch** for your pull requests (PRs).
  Example:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```

---

### ✅ Best Practices for Contributions

* Write **clean, readable code** and follow the project's coding conventions.
* Use **clear and descriptive commit messages**.
* Try to **make PRs focused** on a single change/feature.

---

### 📸 Feature Documentation

Whenever you add a **new feature**, please include:

* 🖼️ **At least one image** (e.g., a screenshot or UI snippet).
* 🎥 **A short video** demo (GIFs or screen recordings are great).

You can upload these to GitHub directly or use tools like [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) or [Gyazo](https://gyazo.com/).

### 🧪 Testing & Validation

* Test your feature locally before submitting a PR.
* Make sure it doesn’t break any existing functionality.

2. Create a branch from `main` or `dev`:
